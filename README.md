[00:14.57] Pixelated kisses got me goin' insane
[00:18.32] Replicate this moment from a million miles away
[00:22.13] Waiting for the signal, baby, never make a sound
[00:25.83] If you never hear from me, all the satellites are down
[00:29.68] Yeah, they're all fucking down
[00:44.68] 
[00:33.75] Falling through the atmosphere right now
[00:37.49] Baby, are you really down?
[00:40.74] Baby, are you really down?
[00:43.39] (Ooh-ooh)
[00:47.89] 
[00:47.57] Ooh, yeah
[00:50.08] Oh, it's a pixelated mess (it's a pixelated mess), uh
[00:52.38] This could be the best right here
[00:54.20] Yeah, this could be the best, or it could be the end (yeah)
[00:58.03] I don't got to try, just give me a hand
[01:01.27] I'm about to change your life (let's go)
[01:21.27] 
[01:03.96] It's causin' me damage, turn it again
[01:05.96] Burn it again, turnin' the page
[01:07.81] Do it again and show all your friends and- (whoo-ooh)
[01:11.45] I don't give a - what you say
[01:13.52] You do what I say, I-I-I need you where I'm at
[01:36.52] 
[01:18.67] Pixelated kisses got me goin' insane
[01:22.41] Replicate this moment from a million miles away
[01:26.35] Waiting for the signal, baby, never make a sound
[01:29.78] If you never hear from me, all the satellites are down
[01:33.53] Yeah, they're all fucking down
[01:48.53] 
[01:37.59] Falling through the atmosphere right now
[01:41.35] Baby, are you really down?
